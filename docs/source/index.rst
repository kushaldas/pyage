Welcome to pyage's documentation!
=================================


age is a simple, secure and modern encryption tool with small explicit keys, no
config options, and UNIX-style composability. The format specification is at
`age-encryption.org/v1 <https://age-encryption.org/v1>`_.

rage is a Rust implementation of the age tool. It is pronounced like the Japanese
`らげ <https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=ja&tl=en&text=%E3%82%89%E3%81%92>`_
(with a hard g).

To discuss the spec or other age related topics, please email
`the mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/age-dev>`_ at
age-dev@googlegroups.com. age was designed by
`@Benjojo12 <https://twitter.com/Benjojo12>`_ and
`@FiloSottile <https://twitter.com/FiloSottile>`_.

The reference interoperable Golang implementation is available at
`filippo.io/age <https://filippo.io/age>`_.

This particular Python module is implemented on top of the Rust crate `age <https://crates.io/crates/age>`_.
